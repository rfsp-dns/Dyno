## **Dyno History**

Before this idea, I was using multiple libraries and frameworks, but I found them either too complicated or not as flexible as I wanted them to be. I wanted something simple that anyone could use.

I started working on **Dyno** over a year ago, but the project was left unfinished after an alpha version. I forgot about it for a while.

On **16 March 2025**, I remembered the project and decided to continue development until it was fully functional and ready for everyone.

## **Version**

Currently, **Dyno** is in **Beta**. I have many ideas to improve the tools and plan to refine and expand upon them over time.

## **Dyno Tools**

### **1. DynoX (JS Automation) (Ongoing)**
**DynoX** is a JavaScript library designed for automating DOM manipulation. It runs automatically before the content has loaded, allowing for seamless interaction with divs, buttons, and other elements. It can add extra content, implement switches, and enhance functionality without requiring manual scripting.

### **2. Dyno (CSS Customization) (Ongoing)**
**Dyno** for CSS offers an easy-to-use customization framework. You can adjust styles dynamically with minimal setup. The CSS file can be modified easily by setting variables, making it ideal for quick changes and lightweight projects.

### **3. DynoZ (CSS Icons) (Onhold)**
**DynoZ** provides a set of scalable, customizable CSS icons that are flexible and easy to integrate into your projects. These icons are designed to be used seamlessly with **Dyno** and **DynoX**.

## **Objective**

- **Simplicity**: The goal is to keep things as simple as possible so developers can focus on what matters most.
