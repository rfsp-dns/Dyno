# LiteCSS History

Before this ideia, I was using BootStrap and I liked it but I felt it was too complicated at the same time, I wanted something simple that everyone could use.

So this project was rotting my mind and I did created it over an year, It had a alpha version but I never finished and I forgot the project.

16 March of 2025, I remembered the project and decided to continue until it was fully functional and ready for everyone.


## Version

For now it's on Beta, I want to do more ideias and refine the other ones.


## Objective

- Be simple as possible.
- You can use a CSS File as a MOD.


# Licence

No licence for now, its open source until further notice.
