## **Dyno History**

Before this idea, I was using multiple libraries and frameworks, but I found them either too complicated or not as flexible as I wanted them to be. I wanted something simple that anyone could use.

I started working on **Dyno** over a year ago, but the project was left unfinished after an alpha version. I forgot about it for a while.

On **16 March 2025**, I remembered the project and decided to continue development until it was fully functional and ready for everyone.

## **Version**

Currently, **Dyno** is in **Beta**. I have many ideas to improve the tools and plan to refine and expand upon them over time.
