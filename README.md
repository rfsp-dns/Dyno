## **Dyno History**

Before this idea, I was using multiple libraries and frameworks, but I found them either too complicated or not as flexible as I wanted them to be. I wanted something simple that anyone could use.

I started working on **Dyno** over a year ago, but the project was left unfinished after an alpha version. I forgot about it for a while.

On **16 March 2025**, I remembered the project and decided to continue development until it was fully functional and ready for everyone.

## **Objective**

- **Simplicity**: The goal is to keep things as simple as possible so developers can focus on what matters most.
- **Flexibility**: You can use each tool independently or together, depending on your projectâ€™s needs.
- **Customizability**: For CSS, you can use the library as a MOD, easily adjusting variables to fit your unique design preferences.
